I like to look under the hood. Passionate about computer science and its
applications to explore the real world.

I build things to go where I can't or to do things I am too lazy to do.

I am currently doing a Ph.D in Exploration robotics and Photogrammetry.
Hence, I like surroundings fields like electronics, vehicle design, data
acquisitions and treatment.


Other hobbies:
- Scuba diving (3 stars)
- VTT
- FPV freestyle drone pilot
- DIY electronics
- Cave exploration
